# Advanced HTML
This directory serves as the eploration of HTML.
It will focus exclusively on this part of front end development.  This creates the backbone of the visual representation of our web apps.  For this we will create a wireframe project for a mock company named `Techium`.
The code will be W3C compliant.
The goal of this directory is to understand how to organize the front end of a web app with the use of HTML.
